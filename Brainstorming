# Proposed workflow:
The overall workflow could be organized in one master script that calls separate scripts for individual tasks:

## Data Collection & Preprocessing Script
Load MRI image data and labels into numpy arrays
Split data into train/validation/test sets
Extract proposed features using sklearn and imaging libraries
Save preprocessed datasets to file

## Model Training Script
Load preprocessed training data
Define and train individual models (knn, logistic regression, etc) using sklearn
Evaluate each model via cross-validation
Tune hyperparameters for each model
Save trained models to file

## Ensemble Development Script
Load saved trained models
Make predictions on validation set using each model
Create ensembles using techniques like averaging, stacking
Evaluate ensemble combinations on validation data
Save best performing ensemble

## Evaluation Script
Load saved ensemble model
Make predictions on held-out test set
Evaluate performance on test data
Generate classification report
The master script would connect these by loading data, calling each script, saving artifacts to file, and piecing together the full pipeline. This modular approach allows separation of concerns.

"I like the idea of creating seperate scripts that we can then call in a 'master' script."
