# CS201R-Tumor-Project
Central repository for all project files. 


## Ideas:
- I think this could be a good place to keep track of goals/tasks, as well as what each of us are working on
- Once we have all looked at the data, I think the first step would be to start deciding on features and firguring out what kind of data preprocessing is required
- Then, I think we could start looking what models we want to use (maybe code up a few scripts to run some debugging/testing and comparing accuracy?)
- Maybe we could add some deadlines for ourselves to stay on-track? Break things down into smaller tasks? 


## Deadlines:
- Group Project Progress Report: 11/7/23
- Hardcopy and Presentation: 12/12/23 (my wedding anniversary, lol)
